# DSA Lab Code Base

This repository contains all the source codes as well as executables of all the
DSA lab assignments.

This code is built using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019.
Open `ProjectName.sln` with MSVS to debug the code with relevant compiler and linker settings.

## Navigating

Every assignment is in its own folder, say - `ProjectName`.
Inside the folder you'll find `Debug` and `Release` along with another `ProjectName` folders
and `ProjectName.sln` file.

`Release` contains executables and object files created by VS. Same goes for `Debug` but,
it has a lot of overhead and performance might not be as good as Release.

Issues and PRs are welcomed! :smile:
